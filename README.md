**iSining** is a an online art gallery mobile and web app built using Jetpack Compose, and following MVVM clean architecture for app development. This is meant to be a straight forward mobile app with a web app as well, and to get up to speed with compose. 

## ‚û°Ô∏èTimeline + Context 

This project came from members of [Mobile+Web Dev Solo Inc](https://github.com/Android-Battalion) who then got necessary resources to finish off the project. The app was up during development and was presented to a class and the in-house API ultimately was down after. There is plans for this to come back up by a few interested in-house members, for the time being the project is at a stall and for viewing purposes.
